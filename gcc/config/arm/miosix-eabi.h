 * RATIONALE: adding builtin_define to always define _MIOSIX
 * - when libgcc/libstdc++/newlib are compiled, as there are some #ifdef _MIOSIX
 * - when Miosix processes are compiled, to allow #ifdef _MIOSIX
 * Also add versioning to miosix-specific compiler patches.
 * Note: intentionally breaking compatibility with previous compiler patches
 * which defined _MIOSIX_GCC_PATCH_VERSION instead of _MIOSIX_GCC_PATCH_MAJOR
